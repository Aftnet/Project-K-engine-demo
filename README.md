# Project K Engine Demo

This was the very first game application I created, a vertical scrolling shooter developed in Flash and ActionScript. The game has been inspired by titles such as Ikaruga and Rez, with the bonus system and its ties to the ability to use smart bombs being my only major design contribution.

## Controls:
Use the arrow keys to move the ship, spacebar to fire and control to deploy a smart bomb and kill all enemies on screen. 

## System Requirements:
Windows 2000 or later (EXE version), a browser with the Adobe Flash plug-in (version 8.0 or later) installed (SWF version), a reasonably fast CPU (Intel Core 1.6 GHz or better), 512+ MB RAM, audio output devices.
The source .fla file is a Macromedia Flash 7 one; as I haven’t had a chance to use Flash since, I don’t know whether it can be opened in current versions of the IDE.
